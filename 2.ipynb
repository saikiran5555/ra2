    "Adjusted R-squared and R-squared are both statistical measures used in the context of regression analysis to indicate how well a model explains the variability in the dependent variable. However, they have key differences in how they interpret the explanatory power of the model, especially in relation to the number of predictors used.\n",

    "R-squared:\n",
    "Definition: R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It is a number between 0 and 1.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared:\n",
    "Definition: Adjusted R-squared, like R-squared, measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, but it also takes into account the number of predictors in the model. It adjusts the R-squared value based on the number of predictors and the sample size.\n",

    "Interpretation: Adjusted R-squared compensates for the addition of variables that do not improve the model's ability to predict. If a variable added to the model doesn't improve the model significantly, the adjusted R-squared will decrease. This is not necessarily true for R-squared, which can increase simply by adding more variables, regardless of their relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "Penalty for Excess Predictors: Adjusted R-squared penalizes the model for adding predictors that do not contribute to its predictive power. In contrast, R-squared can increase with the addition of more predictors, leading to potentially overfitting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Reliable for Multiple Regression: Adjusted R-squared is generally more reliable than R-squared for evaluating the goodness-of-fit in models with multiple predictors. It's a more robust measure when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: While both are bounded between 0 and 1, adjusted R-squared is usually lower than R-squared unless the model is perfect or nearly perfect. It can also be negative if the model is worse than the mean model."
